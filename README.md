# 🔍 K-Means Clustering Model

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of the **K-Means Clustering algorithm**, an unsupervised machine learning technique used to group similar data points into clusters based on distance metrics.  
The goal of this project is to understand clustering behavior, identify patterns in data, and visualize how data points are grouped.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Implement K-Means clustering from scratch using Python libraries
- Perform data preprocessing and scaling
- Identify the optimal number of clusters
- Visualize clusters and centroids
- Interpret clustering results
